# Noisy
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/1tayH/noisy/tree/master.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/1tayH/noisy/tree/master)

A simple python script that generates random HTTP/DNS traffic noise in the background while you go about your regular web browsing, to make your web traffic data less valuable for selling and for extra obscurity.

Noisy is expected to be executed in Docker, OS doesn't matter.
